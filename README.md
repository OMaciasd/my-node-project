## 📖 Project Description

This project allows the management of items via a basic CRUD form, where you can:

- Add a new item.
- View a list of items.
- Edit an existing item.
- Delete an item.

The data can be stored in either a JSON file or a database.

### 🛑 Considerations

- **Security**: For this test, advanced security mechanisms such as authentication or thorough data validation have not been included.

## ✅ Requirements

- [node](https://nodejs.org/en).
- 🐳 [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- Git.
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions).

## 🔧 Installation and Setup

1. Clone the frontend and backend repositories from GitHub:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omaciasd/form-javascript.git

   ```
   
2. Navigate to each project folder:

   ```bash
   cd form-javascript/

   ```

## 🚀 Running the Project

To start the complete application using Docker Compose:

1. Navigate to the folder where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located and run:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build

   ```
2. ## 🌐 Accessing the Application

- The **frontend** will be available by NGINX as inverse proxy [http://localhost:80](http://localhost:80).

## ⚙️ CI/CD and Deployment on Render

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Integration (CI) and **Render** for Continuous Deployment (CD).

### CI Pipeline

Every time a *push* is made to the `main` branch, the following pipeline is triggered:

1. **Unit testing**: Automated tests are run to ensure code integrity.
2. **Docker image build**: Docker images for both frontend and backend are built.
3. **Render deployment**: If all steps pass successfully, the application is deployed to **Render**.

### 🌐 Deployment on Render

The project is configured to be deployed on **Render**, which provides a managed server infrastructure for both applications (frontend and backend).

- **Frontend** is deployed as a web service accessible at [https://form-javascript.render.com](https://form-javascript-onyv.onrender.com).

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **DevOps**: Docker, Docker Compose.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Render.
- **🚧 TDD**: Postman, CURL.
